# Hotel Reservation Cancellation Prediction

## Introduction

This machine learning project aims to predict hotel reservation cancellations using a dataset obtained from Kaggle. It addresses the prevalent challenges faced by hotels due to cancellations and no-shows, a significant issue in the hospitality industry amplified by the advent of online booking channels.

## About the Dataset

The dataset, acquired from Kaggle, contains comprehensive information on hotel reservations, encompassing various features related to bookings, customer details, and reservation status. The primary objective is to construct predictive models capable of anticipating reservation cancellations. These models can assist hotels in efficiently managing resources and minimizing revenue loss.

### Context

Online hotel reservation channels have significantly transformed booking dynamics and customer behavior. Cancellations or no-shows constitute a considerable portion of hotel reservations, stemming from reasons such as changes in plans or scheduling conflicts. While convenient for guests, these cancellations pose revenue and resource management challenges for hotels.

## Techniques and Models Used

This project employs a diverse set of machine learning algorithms and techniques to predict reservation cancellations. The following models were implemented:

- VotingClassifier
- SVC (Support Vector Classifier)
- LogisticRegression
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- AdaBoostClassifier
- BaggingClassifier
- GradientBoostingClassifier
- RandomForestClassifier
- ExtraTreesClassifier
- KNeighborsClassifier

Additionally, GridSearchCV was utilized to fine-tune parameters in the GradientBoostingClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, and ExtraTreesClassifier models, enhancing their predictive performance.
